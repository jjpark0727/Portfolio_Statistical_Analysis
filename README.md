## #1 Project. Application of Ordinal Logistic Regression on the Relationship between Breakfast and Energy Level

- **Project Overview**

This is a research project that I conducted for a course named *Communication for Statisticians* at the University of Minnesota. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of having breakfast on energy level using Ordinal Logistic Regression model. 



- **Summary**

   (1) Data Collection  
   - Source: An open-ended virtual environment called the *“Island”*(located at *http://island.maths.uq.edu.au*)  
   - Subject: Randomly selected 225 participants living on the *Island*  
   - Collected data: gender, village where they live, energy level, minutes of exercise, hours of sleep, and whether they had breakfast this morning  
   - Data collection method: Questionnaires  
   
   
   (2) Data Pre-processing  
   - Data cleansing  
   - EDA  
   
   
   (3) Modeling  
   - Ordinal Logistic Regression  
   
   
   (4) Report  
   - Research paper published
   
   
   (5) Review  
   Although I was already familiar with logistic regression model, which is one of the most well-known and powerful methods to analyze a categorical response, I never had a chance to take a deep dive into the application of 'ordinal logistic regression model' and to apply it to my analysis. Thus, this research project was a great opportunity for me to learn how to deal with data with a categorical response with order as well as to derive meaningful insights by applying the appropriate model.
